This arrow deals Anemo DMG based on the DMG of a fully charged Aimed Shot from 'Normal Attack: Parthian Shot.' Pressurized Collapse: The Hurricane Arrow will apply a Pressurized Collapse effect to the opponent or character hit. This effect will be removed after a short delay, creating a vortex that deals AoE Anemo DMG and pulls nearby objects and opponents in. If the Hurricane Arrow does not hit any opponent or character, it will create a Pressurized Collapse effect at its point of impact. The vortex DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG."
